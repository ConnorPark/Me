  <h2 style="font-family:Quicksand""> Samsung Galay Note 7, Don't Hate On It!</h2>
<p style="font-family:Quicksand">Imagine the best phone in the world in your hands. 
     Now imagine looking through hate articles af it just because it explodes. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7. That is what i'm talking about
      Should you hate it? No. It's like Donald Trump. Just because he said some stupid stuff doesnt mean you should hate him.(I'm Not being a hipocrite)
       Lots of people love the Note 7. Soon, all the explosions will stop because of the update allowing only 60% of battery. There's still a lot of 
     features about the Note 7 that you love. The iris scanner (an eye scanner). The 5.7 SUPER AMOLED</p>
