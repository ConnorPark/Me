        <p style="font-family:Quicksand;font-size:40px">     I never had a Google Pixel before, but I do know that it is Awesome.  
        The specs, the camera, and the software. Lots of people want this phone by Google, and I don't blame them. 
        It might not suceed against the Iphone 7 and 7 plus, but I know that it will do well. 
        The Pixel's main selling point is the Stock-Android expirience. The new Android 7.0 Nougat has some features stolen from 
        Samsung's expirience such as; the dual screen, and the clear all button. The camera has recieved an 89 in the DxOMark test, the
        best score given in any test. If you don't want this phone, you either love Apple or you're just stupid.</p>
