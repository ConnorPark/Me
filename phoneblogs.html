        <p style="font-family:Quicksand">     I never had a Google Pixel before, but I do know that it is Awesome.  
        The specs, the camera, and the software. Lots of people want this phone by Google, and I don't blame them. 
        It might not suceed against the Iphone 7 and 7 plus, but I know that it will do well. 
        The Pixel's main selling point is the Stock-Android expirience. The new Android 7.0 Nougat has some features stolen from 
        Samsung's expirience such as; the dual screen, and the clear all button. The camera has recieved an 89 in the DxOMark test, the
        best score given in any test.</p>
