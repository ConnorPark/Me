        <p style="font-family:Quicksand">                   I never had a Google Pixel before, but I do know that it is Awesome.  
        The specs, the camera, and the software. Lots of people want this phone by Google, and I don't blame them. 
        It might not suceed against the Iphone 7 and 7 plus, but I know that it will do well. 
        The Pixel's main selling point is the Stock-Android expirience.</p>
